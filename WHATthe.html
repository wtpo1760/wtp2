    <h1>What's going on at 1760 Bush Street? <span class="h4">Angel Rittenburg, Treasurer | Update on Nomination Meeting</span></h1>
  </div>
    <h3>Catch-up after COVID: Margo brings 1760 Bush back to CCSD</h3>
    <p>In March 2023, Margo was appointed to a CCSD Committee to help bring the other Affiliated Tenant Associations out of dormancy after the COVID Era by helping Tenants and Boards re-engage. Margo was to help other TAs re-establish democratic operations, have regular meetings, represent tenants, and build community. The Committee was also tasked with helping Tenants understand how a TA operates by providing Officer Training so Tenants understood and could make informed decisions.</p>
    <p>Over the summer, Margo had shared with the rest of the Board that she along with CCSD had started their work. She said CCSD and her were working on developing the Board Officer Training to start around August or September. She suggested we encourage all Tenants to attend those sessions so Tenants could understand what the Board is, what it does, and bring new people in for the roles.</p>
    <p>Margo also suggested 1760 have a nomination and election in October and November for the Board.
    <strong>We all agreed that was a good plan</strong> and agreed to hold Nominations in October of 2024.</p>
    <h3>On Saturday morning, May 14, 2024, Margo posted a flier for the Nomination and Election meetings.</h3>
        <ul class="h4">
            <li>The other 3 Board members did not know</li>
            <li>Document has No date, Board Officer signature, on the letter. <br />It could be from anyone</li>
            <li>Margo was asked to simply push the Nomination meeting a week, not cancel the entire process.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>All I did was ask for Margo to slow down, not stop the process.</h3>
    <h4>Elections are important and should be treated with professionalism, not contempt.</h4>
    <h4>Residents Rights should be honored and defended by the Board, not rewritten to fit any one person's ambition from 8 years ago.</h4>
    <p>I won’t publish the transcription of the text exchanged between Margo and the other Board members.
        I will share my portion of the text exchange with any 1760 Tenant who asks.</p>
        <p></p>For Tenants of 1760 Bush Street, upon request I will arrange a viewing of the screenshots from the entire transcript. No digital format will be available for download or sharing. I cannot guarantee discrecion if I share it digitally.
        -Margo’s cel phone is paid for by the Tenants Association and she was elected by the Tenant’s, so there is no expectation of privacy when it comes to sharing the 1760TA business on a phone paid for by the 1760TA.</p>

        <h2>After a couple days, we had an Emergency Board Meeting to address the issue.</h2>
        <p>We met in Michelle's apartment.</p>
        <p>We each reminded Margo she acted without at least a phone call or text before she posted the flier. We all gave Margo a chance to include us moving forward, we never asked to stop the process, just to ensure that we comply with the Code of Federal Regulations. We all left and after we all seemed to get along very well.</p>
        <p>I thought we all were heard, and all had a chance to "get it all out".</p>
        <p>About an hour after the meeting ended, I knocked on Margo's door to present her a gift as a symbol of respect and cooperation after the earlier meeting.</p>
        <h4>The morning after the Emergency Board Meeting, the 3 page note below was taped outside of my front door in an envelope.</h4>
        <p><span class="mark">I chose to share the note because this is about the Nomination and Election Margo called, technically open to all Residents of 1760 Bush.</span></p>
        <p>Check <a href="#SupremeMM"></a> this link to Page 3 and gain some insight about how Margo thinks government works.</p>
