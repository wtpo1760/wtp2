        <p>Hello Dear Tenants</p>
        <p>I'd like to alert you to a potentially big problem I am having with CC-S/D (Citywide Council Senior Disabled) is in disarray to put it mildly.</p>
        <p>Since becoming their president after six months, I thought I would be able to lead it to at least close to what Beverly Saba envisioned for the organization which she led to greatness for many years until her death.</p>
        <p>Since then CCSD has had a succession of ill-equipped Presidents, for example: Dennis Katrones (2018-2022) would fight loudly at Board meetings for a year combating Mary (Wu) his Secretary getting nothing done, setting the dysfunctional tone, finally taking the fight to Civil Court then having it thrown out. Next president Peter Kats saw the disorganization and quit... Then I came along.</p>
        <p>If you know me at all you know I have a deep seated concern for our Rights and our Community. Ever since I was homeless living on the streets for a year. I've garnered a healthy Attitude of Gratitude and I don't take our roof (or benefits) for granted.</p>
        <p>I am passionate regarding our human rights and our Tenant Rights now falling under HUD's Public-private subsidized housing laws and Section 8 (voucher program). I've consistently studied these new laws and the rights that come with them.I pride myself on being YOUR Advocate when you don't get anywhere with problems or concerns of your household. I study rent calculation and re-certification procedures and count myself <span class="mark">generally ready to represent our collective voices to The Housing Commissioners SFHA <img src="imgz1760/left-point.png" alt="" style="float: right; margin-right: -60px; width: 120px;;">San Francisco Housing Authority and to Helen Hale now promoted to Director of the Mayor's Office on Housing</span></p>
        <p>I've continued to stay motivated to bring YOU the best environment for us to cohabitate,doing what I can to make our lives better here in Public-Private Housing.</p>
        <p>So I generally was looking forward to taking on the position as Leader for CCSD for a longtime. Now, not to [sic] sure.
        Every Board meeting I go to at CCSD ends in a practical fist fight. members insult each other, don't wait for their turn to talk, shout derogatory remarks and curse at each other. they act worse than children.How can they, or I, hope to get anything done? Their affiliates are pulling out one after another.</p>
        <p>However, armed with my tales of dysfunction, <span class="mark">I went to Helen Hale, whose job it is to sort out these things through. She actually said to me, Slow down, you're getting too much done.She actually asked me to not be so functional but instead to match the dysfunction of the Board. who are famous for not taking action between stipend checks, by the way.</p>
        <p>I asked Helen Hale What benefit would you possibly have to keep CCSD dysfunctional? and got no response. Now rumor tells me she has bought in with the builders or just given up on the effectiveness of any resident council. Now, it starts to make sense.</p>
        <p>Helen's vision is that if you have a problem or concern just go to Management. If they refuse to act, go to their supervisor. Tenants have met with retaliation when doing this in many instances and never receive confidentiality and their situations don't change.</p>
        <p>Then I asked about security: I asked, Does the Owner have any responsibility to provide security? She stated, point blank: NO. Saying that it's not in our lease. Well, a little investigation further alerted me that these owners HAVE to swear their buildings are secure BEFORE receiving any money from HUD.Its #6 on the application!! She looked at my face, and lied</p>
        <p>My vision and the way it was explained to me was if a tenant has a problem they can't solve on your [sic] own, bring it to the Resident Council. If the Resident Council (your tenant association) can't do anything they bring it to CCSD to solve. If CCSD can't do anything to help, they bring the problem to the Commissioners, (who incidentally, put it on Helen's shoulders).</p>
        <p>Cue my proposal. I'm promoting CCSD have an Oversight Board in between them and the Commissioners, called Resident Council Advisors or RCA; needed to make sure CCSD is acting appropriately. That's how Democracy works. having Checks and balances of Offices.</p>
        <p>Our collective voice is at risk right now, but I believe we are stronger together! I'm losing hope that CCSD can be fixed on my own.They are furious with me for calling them out on the way they conduct themselves and may soon vote me out of being the president of CCSD. that's okay because when my proposal gets approved, I'll be their boss.
        They need to be held to a higher standard. They need to be held accountable.</p>
        <p><span class="mark">I have <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13gHCpVF6BAPzvkY-k7MxavQHH2NTHyHH/view" target="_new">my RCA</a> circulating at City Hall, The Commissioners, HUD, and anywhere I can think of right now.</span></p>
        <p><span class="mark">RAD will not survive without it. I realize we won't be subsidized Housing in 99 years.which is how long the Government promised to lease the land (which is more like 91 years which the builders trying to renegotiate by the way!) Know that while I'm alive to fight the good fight, God willing, what I'll do. If this is politics, count me in.</span></p>
        <a id="stillCCSD"></a>
        <p>I hope you'll be pleased to not only support me as your president of 1760 Bush Street Tenants Association in the upcoming election but that you may join in the collective voice when RCA gets approved.</p>
        <img src="imgz1760/left-point.png" alt="" style="float: right; margin-right: -60px; width: 120px;;">
        <p>I'll be looking for good people to be represented [sic]. <span class="mark">I'll also have to ask for your formal vote to disassociate with CCSD</span> until there is oversight. Until there is, we'll be wasting our money giving any to fund the groups' dysfunction.</p>
        <p>We need to save our democracy now more than ever, a Democracy which is fueled by collective voice. I know you might not like the candidates right now, but Democracy is on the line.Having a dictator will not protect our children or our future. Stand Strong! (while you still can)</p>
        <p>Anyone interested in seeing my RCA proposal, contact me at 1760bushpresident@gmail.com or @#618</p>
        <p>Also anyone interested in joining the TA board, can come along with any affiliate on any 2nd Saturday of the month from 1-3 pm in the Community Room for officer training.
        Light refreshments will be served.</p>
        <p>Sincerely Your Loving President, </p>
        <p>Of The 1760 Bush Street Tenant Association Margaret M. McNulty</p>
        <p>Fighting the good fight! </p>
